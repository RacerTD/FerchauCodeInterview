# FerchauCodeInterview
 
This is my code for a code interview at Ferchau.
The application is a small program for managing customers, cars and currently rented out cars for a car renting company.
The application was created usign Visual Studio Community 2022 and can be build there.

1. How to Build the Project

   Clone the Repository.
   Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.

    Visual Studio should automatically restore the NuGet packages used in the project.
    If not, you can manually restore packages by right-clicking the solution in Solution Explorer and selecting Restore NuGet Packages.

4. Build the Solution

    In Visual Studio, go to Build > Build Solution, or press Ctrl+Shift+B.
    Ensure there are no build errors. If there are errors, check that all dependencies are installed correctly.
